# BST 281 QMP Project
- This is a final project for the Spring 2018 course in Genomic Data Manipulation (BST 281) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) on applying the Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP) method to longitudinal fecal samples from a participant with Crohn's Disease (CD) vs. a healthy participant from the [NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP2)](https://www.ibdmdb.org/).
- Group members are [Eunice Yeh](https://github.com/euniceyeh/), Marina Cheng, Anthony Lamattina, and Tian Zhang.
- All downloaded and analysis-ready datasets are stored under `/data`.
- A summary and visual presentation of our main findings can be found under `/results`.
- The main objective of our project is to compare the novel QMP method proposed by [Vandeputte et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24460) to the standard relative profiling method widely used in the field by applying it on data collected and made publicly available by the HMP2 project, and from qPCR additionally performed courtesy of [Curtis Huttenhower](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/) & colleagues at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/infectious-disease-microbiome).

Hope you enjoy our project!
