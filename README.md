# BST 281 QMP Project
- This is a final project for the Spring 2018 course in Genomics Data Manipulation (BST 281) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) on applying the Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP) method to longitudinal fecal samples from a patient with Chron's Disease (CD) and a healthy patient from the [Human Microbiome Project (HMP)](https://www.ibdmdb.org/).
- Group members are [Eunice Yeh](https://github.com/euniceyeh/), Marina Cheng, Anthony Lamattina, and Tian Zhang.
- All downloaded and analysis-ready datasets are stored under `/data`.
- A summary and visual presentation of our main findings can be found under `/results`.
- The main objective of our project is to compare the novel QMP method proposed by [Vandeputte et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24460) to the standard relative profiling method widely used in the field by applying it on data collected and publicly available by the HMP project, courtesy of [Curtis Huttenhower](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/).

Hope you enjoy our project!
